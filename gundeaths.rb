##A Simple Gun Death Statistics App

##The basic idea for this app is to query data on gun deaths in the United States and compare them over a few different quantities, 
##such as year or the type of weapon involved. I will attempt to do this in a simple way by pulling compiled data from Gun Violence Archive's 
##online records via web scraping, followed by manually calculating and displaying the statistical differences in this script.
